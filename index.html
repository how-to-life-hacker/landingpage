            <h1>Hack of the Day</h1>
            <p>There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Here's something that's fun. You are only limited by your imagination. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff.</p>
